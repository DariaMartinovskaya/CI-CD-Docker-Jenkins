# Continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD)

While CI is the process to build and test automatically, CD deploys all code changes in a build to the testing or staging environment. CD makes it possible to release builds to the production environment when needed. 
Leveraging both Jenkins and Docker, robust CI/CD pipelines can be designed that enable continuous code integration and reliable application deployments.

# Docker

Docker is a platform for running applications in an isolated environment called a "container" (or Docker container).

How I configured Docker and built a project is described <a href="https://github.com/DariaMartinovskaya/CI-CD-Docker-Jenkins/blob/main/Docker.md">here</a>.

# Jenkins

Jenkins is a Java-based open-source automation platform with plugins designed for continuous integration. It is used to continually create and test software projects, making it easier for developers and DevOps engineers to integrate changes to the project and for consumers to get a new build.

The difference between Docker and Jenkins: Jenkins is focused on automating and orchestrating the CI/CD process, while Docker is primarily focused on packaging and running applications in containers for portability and consistency.
